# FHIR based Tele Consultation Proof of Concept


This repository contains the source code for web application that was created as a short demo to showcase the interoperability capabilities of FHIR during the [NCII FHIR Teleconsult Track of first ever connectation by HL7 India](https://hl7india.in/fhir-connectathon-july-2020/). The base version of this code is just as a prof of concept and cannot be used for any real live cases. It was done as a quick hack to build a rudimentary web client supporting FHIR.

You can clone the entire repo and copy the folder in any web server document root or subfolders and then access the demo.
